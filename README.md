# AirPassengers-analysis
Dataset analysis using python, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and ARIMA.

Dataset: AirPassengers.csv

Completed task:

1. Visualize the data on a graph.
2. Determine whether the time series is stationary.
3. If the data is not stationary, make it stationary (take the logarithm of the time series to reduce the rate of increase of the moving average. It is also necessary to use the method of subtracting the moving average from the logarithm of the time series).
4. Use the ARIMA model from the statmodels library to analyze the data for the next 10 years.
5. Display the predicted data on a graph (using plot_predict)
